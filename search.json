Using data from the diabetes registry, auto populate the TMR database screening form (Ascension = manual entry):\n\nDate of Birth\nDate of Diabetes Diagnosis\nDate of Last Clinic Visit\n\nAuto-Calculate:\n\nAge\nDuration of Diabetes\nTime since last visit\n\nFlag Eligible / Non-Eligible\nEligible participants are randomly reordered, then pushed to a REDCap “potentially eligible” report for use by the community health workers.\n\nEligibility Screening Part 1. Draw registry data into new registry instrument. Calculate derived variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nLabel\nField type\nCoding\nRequired\n\n\n\n\ndob_registry\n(auto-populate) Date of birth\nYYYY-MM-DD\n–\nY\n\n\ndodiag_registry\n(auto-populate) Date of diabetes diagnosis\nYYYY-MM-DD\n–\nY\n\n\ndolv_registry\n(auto-populate) Date of last clinic visit\nYYYY-MM-DD\n–\nY\n\n\nddur_registry\n(derived) Duration of diabetes\ntext (decimal)\nPresent as Years and Weeks\nY\n\n\ndiab6_registry\n(derived) Has the potential participant been diagnosed for 6 years or less\nyesno\n0/1\nY\n\n\ndiab10_registry\n(derived) Has the potential participant been diagnosed for 10 years or less\nyesno\n0/1\nY\n\n\nvisit12_registry\n(derived) 1 or more visits in the past year\ntext (decimal)\n–\nY\n\n\ntmr_eligible1\n(auto-calculated) Is participant eligible so far for TMR pilot?\nyesno\n–\nY\n\n\n\nEligibility Process Part 2. If eligible from Screening Part 1, create report / list of these eligible participants, along with their eligible values. This list will be held in the TMR database, randomly reordered. It will be used by the community health workers when contacting potential participants for interest, and if interested to attend an in-person screening visit.\nThe Table below documents the additional variables collected at this in-person screening visit.\nIf the participant is still eligible after Part 2, they should be asked if they are interested in hearing more about the pilot, or interested in taking part.\n\nIf they are interested - schedule a baseline visit\nIf they are not interested - ask about using their registry data in the control group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nLabel\nField type\nCoding\nRequired\n\n\n\n\ndob_screen\nConfirm date of birth\nYYYY-MM-DD\n–\nY\n\n\ndov_screen\nDate of screening visit\nYYYY-MM-DD\n–\nY\n\n\nddur_screen\n(derived) Calculate duration of diabetes\ntext (decimal)\nPresent as Years and Weeks\nY\n\n\ndiab6_screen\n(derived) Has the potential participant been diagnosed for 6 years or less\nyesno\n0/1\nY\n\n\ndiab10_screen\n(derived) Has the potential participant been diagnosed for 10 years or less\nyesno\n0/1\nY\n\n\nvisit12_screen\n(derived) 1 or more visits in the past year\ntext (decimal)\n–\nY\n\n\nheight_screen\nHeight\ntext (decimal)\ncm\nY\n\n\nweight_screen\nWeight\ntext (decimal)\nkg\nY\n\n\nbmi_screen\n(derived) Body Mass Index\ntext (decimal)\nkg/m2\nY\n\n\ntmr_eligible2\n(auto-calculated) Is participant eligible for TMR pilot?\nyesno\n–\nY\n\n\ninterested_screen\nAre you interested in taking part in the TMR pilot?\nyesno\n–\nY\n\n\nvisit_scheduled\nIf Yes to taking part, has a baseline visit been scheduled?\nyesno\n–\nY\n\n\ncontrol\nIf No to taking part, might we use their registry data in the control group?\nyesno\n–\nY\n\n\nfu6m\nIf Yes to being a control, are they happy to visit for 1 baseline visit, then every 6 months for diabetes support?\nyesno\n–\nY\n\n\n\nNOTE 1 (13-Jan-2026): As part of this screening process, there will now be some screening questions exploring eating habits. These are to be finalised.\nNOTE 2 (13-Jan-2026): From here, instruments are post-screening, meaning that they are collected only if participants have agreed to join the study",

    "text": "Background and rationale\nType 2 diabetes and obesity represent a major and growing health burden on Saint Helena. A high proportion of adults are living with type 2 diabetes, many with poor glycaemic control and long-term complications. In a small and remote health system, this creates significant clinical, financial, and workforce pressures.\nInternational evidence shows that structured Total Meal Replacement (TMR) programmes can lead to substantial weight loss, improved metabolic health, and—among some people—remission of type 2 diabetes. These effects are most consistently seen in people with relatively recent diagnoses, but benefits also extend to medication reduction, improved quality of life, and reduced long-term service demand.\nRandomised controlled trials, including DiRECT, have already demonstrated that TMR can be effective and safe when delivered with appropriate clinical oversight. The key remaining question for Saint Helena is not whether TMR works in principle, but whether it can be delivered safely, acceptably, and effectively within a small-island health system, and whether the benefits observed elsewhere can be realised locally.\nThis programme therefore adopts an implementation and service-evaluation perspective. The focus is on real-world delivery, system fit, patient experience, and clinical outcomes, rather than on re-examining efficacy under tightly controlled trial conditions.",

Improvements short of remission—such as meaningful weight loss, better glycaemic control, reduced medication use, and improved wellbeing—are considered important and clinically relevant outcomes.",

    "text": "Participant eligibility and recruitment\n\nTarget population\nThe programme is offered to adults with type 2 diabetes living on St Helena or Ascension Island who are overweight or obese and for whom meaningful weight loss is clinically appropriate.\nThe primary target group comprises adults with relatively recent diagnoses of type 2 diabetes who are not using insulin at baseline, reflecting the population in which diabetes remission is most plausible based on existing evidence. Adults using insulin are also eligible to participate but are treated as a secondary, exploratory group with enhanced clinical oversight.\n\n\nInclusion criteria\nParticipants must meet all of the following criteria at screening:\n\nDiagnosis of type 2 diabetes.\nAge 18–65 years.\nBody mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m².\nEngagement with routine diabetes care - assessment as at least 1 clinic visit in the past 12 months.\nWillingness and ability to participate in the programme and attend follow-up visits.\n\nParticipants using insulin are eligible, provided they are assessed as suitable by the clinical team and agree to closer monitoring and medication adjustment during the TMR phase.\n\n\nExclusion criteria\nIndividuals will not be referred to or enrolled in the programme if they have:\n\nPregnancy, breastfeeding, or plans to become pregnant during the early phases of the programme.\nSevere or unstable medical conditions that would make rapid weight loss unsafe (e.g. recent myocardial infarction or stroke, severe heart failure, advanced renal disease).\nActive eating disorders, substance use disorders, or conditions that would impair safe participation (assessed at screening).\nPrior bariatric surgery.\nAny other clinical or practical factors judged by the care team to make participation unsafe or inappropriate.\n\nA full operational list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is available on the website eligibility page\n\n\nIdentification and recruitment\nPotential participants are identified through the island’s diabetes registry, local adverts, and clinic lists. Eligible individuals are contacted and invited to attend a screening visit, during which eligibility is confirmed, the programme is explained, and interest in participation is assessed.\nRecruitment is intentionally pragmatic. All eligible and willing individuals are offered the programme until capacity is reached. Individuals who decline participation are not excluded from routine care, and—with appropriate consent—their registry data may be used to support comparative analyses.\nRecruitment, screening outcomes, and baseline scheduling are tracked using REDCap-based tools to ensure transparency, auditability, and linkage to subsequent clinical and evaluation data.\n\n\nConsent\nWritten informed consent is obtained prior to baseline assessment. Consent covers participation in the programme, collection and use of clinical data for evaluation purposes, and—where applicable—participation in qualitative components such as interviews or surveys.\nParticipants may withdraw from the programme or from evaluation activities at any time without affecting their access to routine clinical care.",

    "text": "Description of the intervention\nThe Total Meal Replacement (TMR) programme is a structured, time-limited dietary intervention followed by phased food reintroduction and longer-term weight maintenance support. It is delivered within routine diabetes services, with regular clinical monitoring and medication adjustment to ensure safety.\nThe programme is organised into three main phases. While the overall structure is standardised, delivery allows limited flexibility to accommodate individual needs, preferences, and clinical circumstances.\n\nPhase 1: Total Meal Replacement (weeks 0–12)\nParticipants replace all usual meals with nutritionally complete meal-replacement products for approximately 12 weeks. Daily energy intake is substantially reduced, with the aim of achieving rapid and clinically meaningful weight loss.\nDuring this phase:\n\nDiabetes and blood pressure medications are reviewed and adjusted according to agreed clinical protocols.\nParticipants are seen regularly for weight checks, symptom review, and clinical monitoring.\nBlood glucose and blood pressure are monitored closely, particularly in the early weeks.\nParticipants receive behavioural support and practical guidance to support adherence and wellbeing.\n\nThis phase carries the greatest potential for rapid metabolic improvement and therefore also requires the most intensive clinical oversight.\n\n\nPhase 2: Food reintroduction (approximately weeks 12–18)\nFollowing completion of the TMR phase, participants transition gradually back to food-based meals. Meal-replacement products are reduced in a stepwise manner while balanced meals are reintroduced.\nThe focus during this phase is on:\n\nMaintaining weight loss achieved during TMR.\nEstablishing sustainable eating patterns.\nSupporting participants to understand portion sizes, food choices, and meal timing.\n\nClinical monitoring continues during food reintroduction, with medication adjusted as required.\n\n\nPhase 3: Weight maintenance and follow-up (weeks 19+)\nAfter food reintroduction, participants enter a longer-term weight maintenance phase. The aim is to stabilise weight, prevent regain, and support sustained improvements in glycaemic control.\nFollow-up during this phase includes:\n\nPeriodic clinical review and weight monitoring.\nOngoing support for diet, physical activity, and behaviour change.\nContinued review of diabetes medications, including opportunities for further de-intensification.\n\nWhere weight regain or deterioration in glycaemic control occurs, additional support or temporary return to meal replacement may be offered, guided by clinical judgement.",

These protocols are designed to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia, symptomatic hyperglycaemia, hypotension, and other adverse effects.\nMedication decisions remain the responsibility of qualified clinicians, with protocols providing guidance rather than rigid rules.\n\n\nAdverse events and escalation\nAdverse events are identified through routine clinical contact and participant self-report. Serious or unexpected events are documented, reviewed, and escalated according to agreed governance pathways.\nA Data Monitoring Group oversees safety during the programme, reviewing emerging issues and recommending modifications if required.\n\n\nGovernance and quality assurance\nThe programme operates under established clinical, information governance, and data protection frameworks.

    "text": "Analysis approach\nThe analysis approach is designed to support a rigorous, implementation-focused service evaluation of the TMR Diabetes Remission Programme in St Helena and Ascension Island. The aim is to generate credible, decision-relevant evidence on outcomes and delivery in routine care, recognising that statistical inference is one component of a broader evaluation that also considers feasibility, safety, and acceptability.\nAnalyses will be conducted in accordance with the Statistical analysis plan (sap) , which provides full technical detail. The summary below describes the overall analytic strategy and interpretive principles.\n\nOverall analytic strategy\nThe evaluation uses a non-randomised, observational design appropriate to service delivery. Analyses combine:\n\nregistry-based matched cohort comparisons; and\nlongitudinal modelling of outcome trajectories over time.\n\nThese complementary approaches are used to contextualise outcomes observed among programme participants and to strengthen causal interpretation where feasible, while recognising the limitations inherent in routine-care data.\n\n\nAnalytic populations\nAnalyses are stratified by baseline insulin use, reflecting clinically meaningful differences in complexity and expected outcomes. A primary analytic population (participants not using insulin at baseline) and an exploratory analytic population (participants using insulin at baseline) are defined, as set out in the Statistical Analysis Plan.\nPrimary analyses follow intention-to-treat principles, with additional analyses used to explore the impact of programme exposure and adherence.\n\n\nOutcomes and estimation\nClinical, process, safety, and acceptability outcomes are analysed using appropriate statistical models for repeated measures / longitudinal data. Emphasis is placed on estimation and uncertainty (effect sizes and confidence intervals), with formal hypothesis testing used selectively and interpreted cautiously in light of sample size and service-evaluation context.\nPrimary and secondary endpoints, including definitions of diabetes remission, weight loss thresholds, and medication outcomes, are pre-specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan.\n\n\nInterpretation and robustness\nFindings are interpreted by triangulating results across analytic approaches and outcome domains, rather than relying on single tests or thresholds. Sensitivity analyses are undertaken to assess robustness to key assumptions, including confounding control and missing data, as described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.\nOverall interpretation explicitly integrates quantitative findings with implementation-relevant considerations, recognising that decisions about service continuation or adaptation depend on more than statistical significance alone.\n\n\nQualitative analysis\nQualitative data (including free-text survey responses and semi-structured interviews) are analysed thematically using inductive coding, supported by simple software tools where appropriate. Interviews are conducted in English, digitally recorded, and transcribed verbatim with participant consent. Qualitative findings are used to explain and contextualise quantitative results, particularly around acceptability, feasibility, and barriers and facilitators to engagement.",

The reviewer (study clinician or specialist diabetes nurse) will review patient notes, looking for any pre-existing exclusion factors - such as. This will be recorded by the study clinician or specialist diabetes nurse in the REDCap TMR database screening form:\n\nPregnancy or breastfeeding\nRecent major cardiovascular events\nSevere renal impairment\nActive eating disorder\nOther significant clinical exclusions\n\n\n\n4. Explain Programme Expectations\nCover clearly:\n\nThe intensity of the first 12 weeks\nMedication changes may occur under supervision\nRegular follow-up visits are required\nParticipants can stop at any time\n\nCheck understanding and allow questions.\n\n\n5.

Participation is voluntary, and declining does not affect routine care.\nStep 1: Identification of potentially eligible participants\nData handling staff use the diabetes registry to identify potentially eligible individuals based on:\n\nConfirmed diabetes diagnosis\nDuration of diabetes\nAt least one clinic visit in the previous 12 months\n\nFor all individuals meeting these criteria, registry information is used to pre-populate the REDCap screening form in the TMR database.\nStep 2: Creation of recruitment list in the REDCap TMR database\nUsing the pre-populated screening forms, a REDCap report is generated listing potentially eligible participants. This report functions as the active recruitment list. The community health workers contact individuals in the order presented in the REDCap report, starting from the top of the list.\nStep 3: Recruitment contact\nThe community health workers contact individuals listed in the REDCap recruitment report by telephone or in person.\nDuring recruitment contact:\n\nThe approved recruitment script must be followed closely\nThe purpose of the programme is explained briefly\nThe individual is invited to attend a screening visit to learn more\nIt is made clear that participation is optional and declining will not affect usual care\n\nThe recruitment script is provided as a downloadable document at the top of this SOP and must be used for all recruitment contacts. No screening assessments or consent are undertaken at this stage.\nStep 4: Updating recruitment outcomes in REDCap\nDuring or immediately after recruitment contact, the REDCap screening form is updated to record the outcome, including:\n\nIndividual declined participation\nIndividual agreed to attend a screening visit\n\nThis information is recorded directly in the REDCap database to maintain a real-time recruitment record.\nStep 5: Scheduling the screening visit\nFor individuals who agree to attend a screening visit, the REDCap scheduling functionality in the TMR database is used to book the screening appointment. Once a screening visit is scheduled, the recruitment process for that individual is complete.\nStep 6: Handover to screening\nScreening visits are conducted by the Community Health Worker team, with support from:\n\nThe study data manager\nThe study clinician\nThe study manager\n\nFrom this point onward, procedures are governed by the Screening SOP.",

Improving diabetes outcomes while reducing long-term medication dependence and complications is a strategic priority for the island’s health service.\nTotal Meal Replacement programmes are an evidence-based approach that have demonstrated substantial benefits in multiple settings, including significant weight loss, improved glycaemic control, and, for some individuals, diabetes remission. These benefits are most clearly demonstrated in people with relatively recent diagnoses of type 2 diabetes. However, most of the existing evidence comes from:\n\ncontrolled clinical trials, or\nlarge, well-resourced mainland health systems.\n\nThere is limited evidence on how such programmes perform when delivered within small, remote, integrated health systems with constrained workforce capacity and distinctive food environments, such as St Helena.",

    "text": "Evidence Brief\n\nStrength of Evidence for Total Meal Replacement in Type 2 Diabetes\n(Using GRADE: High, Moderate, Low, Very Low Confidence)\nThis evidence brief summarises the strength and quality of research relevant to implementing a Total Meal Replacement (TMR) programme for adults with type 2 diabetes on Saint Helena. Evidence has been classified using the GRADE framework, which is internationally recognised and applied by WHO, NICE, and Cochrane.\n\n\nTMR Effectiveness for Non-Insulin-Treated Type 2 Diabetes\n\nGRADE Rating: HIGH Confidence\nKey Evidence\n\nMultiple well-designed randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including the high-profile DiRECT study, demonstrate that TMR can produce large weight reductions and achieve diabetes remission in a substantial proportion of adults not on insulin.\nDiRECT and associated studies show remission rates of around 45% at 12 months and around one-third at 24 months among participants with relatively short duration of diabetes.\nMechanistic studies provide strong biological plausibility: sustained hypocaloric intake reduces liver and pancreatic fat and restores first-phase insulin release.\n\nInterpretation: There is high confidence that TMR is an effective metabolic intervention for adults with type 2 diabetes who are not using insulin. Evidence is consistent across multiple populations, settings and methodologies. The metabolic response is well understood, and benefits have been reproduced across trials.\nRelevance to Saint Helena: This high-certainty evidence supports using TMR as a core diabetes intervention for the non-insulin-treated population, recognising that outcomes in real-world delivery may vary slightly from those in a controlled trial setting.\n\n\n\nTMR for Insulin-Treated Type 2 Diabetes\n\nGRADE Rating: MODERATE Confidence\nKey Evidence\n\nEvidence includes small RCTs and structured weight-loss trials showing that insulin-treated individuals can achieve significant reductions in HbA1c and marked reductions in insulin dose.\nSome participants are able to stop insulin entirely during TMR while maintaining acceptable glycaemic control.\nEvidence is less extensive than for non-insulin diabetes and typically involves shorter follow-up periods and smaller sample sizes.\n\nInterpretation: There is moderate confidence that TMR can improve metabolic control and reduce insulin burden in insulin-treated individuals.\nHowever, evidence for long-term remission is weaker, and estimates are more uncertain due to smaller trials and narrower study populations.\nRelevance to Saint Helena: This supports including insulin users as a secondary exploratory group in the island’s implementation. Benefits are likely but less predictable, and safe insulin down-titration is essential.\n\n\n\nSustainability of Weight Loss and Diabetes Remission\n\nGRADE Rating: MODERATE Confidence\nKey Evidence\n\nLong-term follow-up from DiRECT (up to 5 years for some participants) shows that remission can be sustained, but most successful participants maintain weight loss.\nWeight regain commonly leads to relapse, illustrating that maintenance behaviours and structured follow-up matter greatly.\nReal-world programme evaluations (e.g., NHS England) suggest that weight loss is achievable outside trials, but long-term data remain more limited.\n\nInterpretation: There is moderate confidence that sustained remission is achievable with TMR provided that weight loss is maintained.\nConfidence is reduced by the limited number of high-quality long-term datasets and variability in maintenance support across settings.\nRelevance to Saint Helena: Long-term success may depend on culturally aligned maintenance strategies, access to supportive food environments and ongoing behavioural support. The island setting may pose unique challenges but also offers opportunities for system-wide coherence.\n\n\n\nSafety of TMR Programmes\n\nGRADE Rating: HIGH Confidence\nKey Evidence\n\nAcross trials, TMR is generally safe when medications—especially insulin and sulfonylureas—are adjusted appropriately.\nEarly phase monitoring prevents hypoglycaemia or symptomatic hyperglycaemia.\nAdverse effects are typically mild and transient (fatigue, dizziness, coldness).\n\nInterpretation: There is high confidence that TMR programmes are safe when medication withdrawal is supervised. Insulin-treated individuals require particular oversight, but structured protocols mitigate risk.\nRelevance to Saint Helena: A small health system can closely monitor participants, facilitating safe implementation.\n\n\n\nQuality-of-Life and Psychological Effects\n\nGRADE Rating: MODERATE Confidence\nKey Evidence\n\nMany trials show improvements in quality of life (EQ-5D, EQ-VAS) following substantial weight loss.\nDiabetes distress (PAID scores) often decreases, particularly when medication burden falls.\nSome individuals may find the initial TMR phase challenging, but overall wellbeing improves in the majority.\n\nInterpretation: There is moderate confidence that TMR improves quality of life and reduces emotional distress related to diabetes.\nConfidence is moderate because not all studies include validated QoL assessments, and psychological responses can vary across cultures and individuals.\nRelevance to Saint Helena: Monitoring EQ-5D and PAID provides insight into patient experience alongside biomedical outcomes.\n\n\n\nMechanistic Evidence (Liver/Pancreas Fat Reduction, Beta Cell Recovery)\n\nGRADE Rating: HIGH Confidence\nKey Evidence\n\nMRI and metabolic studies have consistently shown rapid reductions in liver fat and gradual reductions in pancreatic fat during TMR.\nRestoration of first-phase insulin secretion is a reproducible physiological effect in non-insulin-treated diabetes.\nMechanistic pathways have been mapped and reproduced across independent research groups.\n\nInterpretation: There is high confidence in the mechanisms explaining why TMR works.\nThis mechanistic clarity strengthens confidence in applying the intervention beyond trial settings.\nRelevance to Saint Helena: Strong mechanistic evidence supports adaptation to local circumstances, because physiological effects are universal regardless of geography.\n\n\n\nEvidence from Real-World Health Systems\n\nGRADE Rating: LOW to MODERATE Confidence\nKey Evidence\n\nReal-world programmes such as NHS England’s “Soups and Shakes” rollout show promising early results.\nReal-world remission rates tend to be lower than RCTs, but weight-loss outcomes remain clinically relevant.\nEvidence varies by implementation fidelity, population characteristics and healthcare system capacity.\n\nInterpretation: There is low to moderate confidence in generalising real-world effectiveness due to heterogeneity of programmes and lack of long-term data. Nevertheless, the consistent direction of benefit strengthens pragmatic confidence.\nRelevance to Saint Helena: A small health system can implement TMR with high fidelity, potentially achieving outcomes closer to trial settings. Monitoring fidelity and process indicators is important in this context.\n\n\n\nEvidence for TMR in Small, Remote or Low-Resource Settings\n\nGRADE Rating: VERY LOW to LOW Confidence\nKey Evidence\n\nLimited published research examines TMR specifically in remote islands or small health systems.\nSome weight-loss and behavioural interventions have been studied in Caribbean and Pacific contexts, but findings may not transfer directly to TMR.\nSupply-chain constraints and food environments differ substantially across islands.\n\nInterpretation: Confidence is low, primarily due to lack of directly relevant studies.\nHowever, absence of evidence does not imply poor effectiveness; instead, it underscores the need for implementation-focused research.\nRelevance to Saint Helena: This gap justifies an implementation science approach—testing feasibility, acceptability and system fit, not only metabolic outcomes.",
