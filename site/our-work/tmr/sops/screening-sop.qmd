## Purpose

This SOP describes the standard process for screening potential participants for the Total Meal Replacement (TMR) Diabetes Remission Programme.

The screening visit is designed to:

- Confirm eligibility and safety
- Provide clear, neutral information about the programme
- Support informed choice
- Identify next steps (baseline visit, control group, or no further contact)

Screening is *not* consent to participate and does not commit the individual to the programme.

The following documents are used directly as part of the screening visit process.

## Scope

This SOP applies to all staff involved in:

- Identifying potential participants
- Conducting screening visits (always in-person)
- Recording screening data in the REDCap TMR database 

## Roles and Responsibilities

*Community Health Workers.* conduct screening, record data, explain next steps

*Study data manager.* Provides REDCap and data system support throughout recruitment.

*Study clinician.* available for clinical queries or borderline cases

*Study manager.* scheduling and follow-up

## Overview of the Screening Process

1. Identify potential participant
2. Initial contact and explanation
3. Screening assessment (eligibility and safety)
4. Confirm interest
5. Agree next step
6. Record outcome

## Detailed Procedure

### 1. Identification of Potential Participants

Potential participants may be identified through:

- Diabetes registry listing (using a report in the REDCap TMR database)
- Clinic lists
- Referrals from clinical staff
- Self-referral following publicity

### 2. Initial Contact

Explain:

- This is a diabetes remission *service*, not a research trial
- Participation is voluntary
- Screening is to see if the programme is suitable and safe

Provide a brief description of:

- Total diet replacement phase
- Follow-on food reintroduction and maintenance
- Time commitment

### 3. Screening Assessment

Confirm or collect the following:

**Core eligibility**

- Age within programme limits
- Type 2 diabetes diagnosis
- Duration of diabetes
- Recent clinic attendance
- Body Mass Index (measured or recent)

**Safety exclusions**

This medical check will likely occur before the screening visit takes place. The reviewer (study clinician or specialist diabetes nurse) will review patient notes, looking for any pre-existing exclusion factors - such as. This will be recorded by the study clinician or specialist diabetes nurse in the REDCap TMR database screening form: 

- Pregnancy or breastfeeding
- Recent major cardiovascular events
- Severe renal impairment
- Active eating disorder
- Other significant clinical exclusions

### 4. Explain Programme Expectations

Cover clearly:

- The intensity of the first 12 weeks
- Medication changes may occur under supervision
- Regular follow-up visits are required
- Participants can stop at any time

Check understanding and allow questions.

### 5. Confirm Interest

Ask neutrally:

- Whether the individual wishes to proceed to a baseline visit

If **yes**:

- Schedule a baseline visit

If **no**:

- Thank the individual
- Ask permission to use routine data as part of the control group (where applicable)

### 6. Record Outcome

In REDCap, record:

- Eligibility outcome
- Interest outcome
- Baseline visit scheduled (yes/no)
- Any notes relevant to safety or follow-up

## Handling Special Situations

- *Borderline eligibility.* escalate to clinical lead
- *Insulin-treated participants.* flag for enhanced clinical oversight
- *Safeguarding concerns.* follow standard clinical procedures

## Documentation

- Screening data is recorded in the screening REDCap database
- No consent forms are signed at screening
