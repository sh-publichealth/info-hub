### What is the baseline visit?

The *baseline visit* is the first full appointment for people who decide to take part in the Diabetes Remission Programme.

This visit helps us:

- Confirm that the programme is right for you
- Record starting measurements so we can track progress safely
- Make sure you feel informed, supported, and ready to begin


## How long will the visit take?

The baseline visit usually takes *about 60–90 minutes*. We will take our time and answer any questions you have.

## What will happen at the baseline visit?

At this visit, a member of our health team will:

- Review the programme again with you and check that you are happy to go ahead
- Go through the *Participant Information Sheet* with you
- Ask you to sign the *Consent Form*, if you have not already done so

### Measurements and checks

To understand your starting point and keep you safe, we will:

- Measure your *height* (if not already done)
- Measure your *weight*
- Measure your *blood pressure*
- Take routine *blood tests*, including diabetes-related tests
- Review your current *medications*
- Do a FibroScan – a simple, painless scan to check your liver health
- Ask how your health affects daily life
- Ask you a few questions about how diabetes affects you emotionally
- Ask a few questions about your usual physical activity
- These measurements are part of routine care and help guide safe support during the programme.

## Talking about medications

As weight and blood sugar levels change, some medications may need to be *reduced or stopped*.

At the baseline visit:

- We will review what medications you are currently taking
- We will explain how medication changes are handled safely
- No changes will be made without clear explanation and clinical oversight

## Starting the programme

If everything is in place, the baseline visit will also:

- Mark the official *start* of the programme
- Confirm the date for beginning the Total Meal Replacement phase
- Explain how and when you will receive the meal replacement products
- Schedule your follow-up appointments

## What will be expected of you?

We will talk openly about:

- Following the programme as closely as you can
- Attending regular appointments
- Staying in contact with the health team if you feel unwell or unsure

You will be supported throughout, and you can raise concerns at any time.

## What should I bring?

Please bring:

- Any *medications* you are currently taking (or a list)
- *Glasses* if you need them for reading
- Any *questions* you would like to ask

## Can I change my mind?

Yes.

Even at the baseline visit, you can decide not to continue.

Your usual diabetes care will continue whether or not you take part.

## Who can I contact?

If you have questions before or after your visit, please contact:
