## Scope

This SOP covers activities from identification of potentially eligible individuals through to the scheduling of a screening visit.
All screening procedures are covered in the Screening SOP. Baseline enrolment is covered in the Baseline SOP.

## Roles and responsibilities

*Data handling staff.* Extract potentially eligible participants from the diabetes registry and prepare recruitment lists within the REDCap Total Meal Replacement (TMR) database.

*Community Health Workers (CHWs)*. Review the REDCap recruitment report to identify potential eligible participants. Select the person at the top of the list and make contact for potential recruitment.

*Study data manager.* Provides REDCap and data system support throughout recruitment.

*Study clinician.* Provides clinical oversight and advice where required.

*Study manager.* Oversees recruitment progress, coordination, and escalation of issues.

## Recruitment overview

Recruitment is a structured, auditable process designed to ensure that individuals are approached consistently, respectfully, and without coercion. Participation is voluntary, and declining does not affect routine care.

**Step 1:** Identification of potentially eligible participants

Data handling staff use the diabetes registry to identify potentially eligible individuals based on:

- Confirmed diabetes diagnosis
- Duration of diabetes
- At least one clinic visit in the previous 12 months

For all individuals meeting these criteria, registry information is used to pre-populate the REDCap screening form in the TMR database.

**Step 2:** Creation of recruitment list in the REDCap TMR database

Using the pre-populated screening forms, a REDCap report is generated listing potentially eligible participants. This report functions as the active recruitment list. The *community health workers* contact individuals in the order presented in the REDCap report, starting from the top of the list.

**Step 3:** Recruitment contact

The *community health workers* contact individuals listed in the REDCap recruitment report by telephone or in person.

During recruitment contact:

- The approved recruitment script must be followed closely
- The purpose of the programme is explained briefly
- The individual is invited to attend a screening visit to learn more
- It is made clear that participation is optional and declining will not affect usual care

The recruitment script is provided as a downloadable document at the top of this SOP and must be used for all recruitment contacts. No screening assessments or consent are undertaken at this stage.

**Step 4:** Updating recruitment outcomes in REDCap

During or immediately after recruitment contact, the REDCap screening form is updated to record the outcome, including:

- Individual declined participation
- Individual agreed to attend a screening visit

This information is recorded directly in the REDCap database to maintain a real-time recruitment record.

**Step 5:** Scheduling the screening visit

For individuals who agree to attend a screening visit, the REDCap scheduling functionality in the TMR database is used to book the screening appointment. Once a screening visit is scheduled, the recruitment process for that individual is complete.

**Step 6:** Handover to screening

Screening visits are conducted by the Community Health Worker team, with support from:

- The study data manager
- The study clinician
- The study manager

From this point onward, procedures are governed by the Screening SOP.

## Documentation and audit trail

All recruitment activity—including eligibility identification, contact attempts, outcomes, and scheduling—is recorded within REDCap. This provides a complete audit trail of recruitment decisions and supports monitoring of recruitment progress and equity.
