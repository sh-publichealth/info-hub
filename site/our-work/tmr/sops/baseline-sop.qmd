# Baseline Visit SOP

## Purpose

This SOP describes the standard process for conducting the **baseline visit** for participants entering the Total Meal Replacement (TMR) Diabetes Remission Programme.

The baseline visit establishes:

- informed consent,

- high-quality baseline measurements,
- safe transition into the intervention or control pathway.

The baseline visit is the **governance anchor point** for the programme.
