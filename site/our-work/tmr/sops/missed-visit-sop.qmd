## Purpose

This SOP sets out a clear, supportive, and proportionate approach to managing missed appointments and leaving the Total Meal Replacement (TMR) Diabetes Remission Programme.

The aim is to:

- protect participant safety,
- support continued engagement where possible,
- ensure clear documentation,
- avoid punitive or judgemental responses.

Leaving the programme (disengagement) is treated as **participant choice**, not failure. For some, recognise that this action may have medication consequences.

------

## Scope

This protocol applies to:

- screening visits,
- baseline visits,
- all follow-up and intervention visits.

It applies to both intervention and control participants.

------

## Definitions

- **Missed appointment:** A scheduled visit not attended without prior cancellation.
- **Leaving the programme:** When a participant chooses not to continue attending visits or programme activities, or is no longer responding to contact attempts.

------

## Guiding Principles

- Assume good intent
- Prioritise safety
- Keep contact respectful and non-intrusive
- Minimise burden on participants and staff
- Document clearly and consistently

------

## Missed Appointment Procedure

### First Missed Appointment

- Record the missed visit in REDCap
- Attempt contact within a reasonable timeframe
- Use neutral, supportive language
- Offer to reschedule

No change in participant status at this stage.

------

### Second Missed Appointment (Consecutive or Recurrent)

- Record the missed visit
- Attempt contact via an alternative method if available
- Check for potential barriers (illness, transport, timing)
- Escalate to clinical lead **if safety concerns are possible** (e.g. insulin use)

------

### Repeated Missed Appointments

If multiple visits are missed without response:

- Record attempts to contact
- Discuss at programme team level
- Consider temporary pause of intervention activities

------

## Leaving the Programme Procedure

### Participant-Initiated Leaving of the Programme

If a participant states they wish to stop:

- Acknowledge and respect the decision
- Reassure that routine clinical care continues
- Ask (without pressure) about continued use of routine data for evaluation
- Record leaving the programme reason if offered

No justification is required from the participant.

------

### Loss to Contact (No Response)

If a participant does not respond after reasonable attempts:

- Record contact attempts
- Update participant status to disengaged
- Inform the clinical lead where safety monitoring is relevant

------

### Safety Considerations

- Participants who have had diabetes or blood-pressure medication reduced or stopped during the programme require **continued clinical supervision** if they leave the programme
- Leaving the programme does **not** mean withdrawal of clinical responsibility
- For these participants, a clear handover to routine diabetes care must be arranged
- Medication review and follow-up arrangements should be documented
- Any safety concerns should be escalated promptly to the clinical lead

------

## Documentation

- All missed appointments and contact attempts must be recorded in REDCap
- Disengagement status and date should be clearly documented
- No judgemental language should be used in records

------

## Review and Oversight

- All missed appointments should be **identified and discussed at the regular project team meeting**
- The purpose of discussion is to identify patterns, practical barriers, and any safety concerns
- Actions agreed (e.g. follow-up approach, schedule adjustment) should be documented

Patterns of missed appointments and leaving the programme may be:

- summarised for internal review,
- reviewed by the Data Monitoring Group where relevant to safety or equity.
