## Why we share data

This project collects health and programme data to help improve care, learn what works, and inform future decisions.

We believe data should be *useful*, *responsible*, and *shared carefully* — not locked away, but never used in ways that could harm people or communities.

This page explains, in simple terms, *what data we may share, how we share it, and the conditions we apply*.

## What data might be shared

We may share:

- Summary results (for example averages, percentages, or trends)
- De-identified individual-level data (data with names, addresses, and direct identifiers removed)
- Supporting documents such as questionnaires, data dictionaries, or analysis notes

We do **not** share names, contact details, or anything that could reasonably identify an individual.

## Who we share data with

We may share data with:

- Health services and policymakers
- Researchers and analysts
- Public health organisations
- Funders and partners
- Others working to improve health and care

All data sharing is assessed on a case-by-case basis.

## How data can be used

Shared data may be used to:

- Improve services and programmes
- Support research and evaluation
- Inform policy or planning
- Produce reports, publications, or public summaries

Data must **not** be used for commercial marketing, advertising, or to make decisions about individuals.

## How we protect people’s privacy

Before any data are shared, we take steps to:

- Remove direct identifiers
- Reduce the risk of re-identification
- Limit what is shared to what is necessary
- Apply clear conditions on use and storage

We follow applicable data protection laws and good practice.

## Conditions of sharing

Anyone receiving data from this project must agree to:

- Use the data only for the agreed purpose
- Not attempt to identify individuals
- Keep the data secure
- Not share the data further without permission
- Acknowledge the source of the data

## How to request data

If you are interested in accessing data from this project, please contact us informally at first at: 

Dr Selvi Jeyaseelan
selvi.jeyaseelan@sainthelena.gov.sh

Include the following information:

- Who you are and who you represent
- What data you are requesting
- How you plan to use it
- How you will store and protect it

We aim to be open, fair, and proportionate in our decisions.

## A more formal agreement

For situations where data are shared outside the project team, we use a short written agreement that sets out these conditions clearly.
