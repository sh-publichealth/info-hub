## Total Meal Replacement (TMR) Diabetes Remission Programme

---

**St Helena Health and Social Care Directorate (HSC)**

**Version 1**

**Date: 05-Jan-2026**

**Prepared by: Ian Hambleton / Selvi Jeyaseelan**

---

## Purpose

The Data Monitoring Group (DMG) provides independent oversight of patient safety, data integrity, and information governance for the Total Meal Replacement (TMR) Diabetes Remission Programme.

The Group’s role is advisory and protective. It is not responsible for programme delivery or performance management.

------

## Scope

The DMG oversees:

- Participant safety and adverse event monitoring
- Data quality, completeness, and integrity
- Appropriate use of participant data in line with agreed purposes
- Emerging risks related to the programme or evaluation

The DMG does **not** assess intervention efficacy or make clinical decisions for individual participants.

------

## Key Functions

The DMG will:

- Review safety data, including adverse events and serious adverse events
- Review recruitment, retention, and disengagement patterns
- Monitor data flows, linkage, and anonymisation practices
- Review any proposed changes to data use or evaluation scope
- Provide advice on risk mitigation and programme safeguards

------

## Membership

The DMG will comprise:

- **Independent Chair** (not involved in programme delivery)
- **Clinical member** with diabetes or metabolic expertise
- **Public health or epidemiology member**
- **Information governance member** (or Caldicott Guardian delegate)

Additional members may be co-opted as required.

A quorum requires the Chair plus at least two other members.

------

## Meetings

- Meetings will be held monthly during active recruitment and early delivery
- Thereafter, meetings may move to a quarterly schedule
- Extraordinary meetings may be convened if safety concerns arise

Meetings may be held virtually.

------

## Information Reviewed

The DMG may review:

- Aggregated safety summaries
- Adverse event logs
- Recruitment and attrition summaries
- Data completeness and quality reports
- Reports of protocol deviations or data incidents

No routinely identifiable participant data will be reviewed unless strictly necessary for safety review.

------

## Decision-Making, Authority, and Guardrails

The DMG is an **independent advisory body** with a defined safety and governance remit. It does not manage day-to-day operations or replace clinical or managerial accountability.

### Nature of Authority

- The DMG **advises** on safety, data integrity, and governance risks
- The Programme Clinical Lead and Senior Responsible Officer (SRO) **retain operational authority**
- DMG recommendations are expected to be taken seriously and responded to formally

The programme is expected to **either implement DMG recommendations or document a clear, reasoned justification for not doing so**.

------

### Areas Where the DMG May Advise

The DMG may make recommendations relating to:

- Participant safety safeguards
- Eligibility criteria application or clarification
- Monitoring frequency for specific subgroups (e.g. insulin-treated participants)
- Temporary changes to procedures following adverse events
- Data collection, linkage, or reporting practices
- Pausing specific activities while risks are reviewed

The DMG does **not** direct individual clinical decisions or staff management.

------

### Examples of DMG Intervention

The following examples illustrate how the DMG may intervene:

- **Safety signal**: If multiple hypoglycaemic events are reported in a short period, the DMG may recommend increased monitoring, protocol clarification, or temporary modification of medication adjustment procedures.
- **Recruitment imbalance**: If recruitment disproportionately excludes a subgroup (e.g. insulin users), the DMG may advise review of screening practices to ensure equity and consistency.
- **Data risk**: If reporting outputs risk inadvertent identification due to small numbers, the DMG may require revised aggregation or suppression rules before dissemination.
- **Process deviation**: If consent procedures are inconsistently applied, the DMG may recommend retraining or checklist revision.
- **Escalation**: In the event of a serious and unresolved safety concern, the DMG may recommend a temporary pause or early termination of the programme.

------

### Escalation and Response

- All DMG recommendations will be documented
- The Programme Team will provide a written response outlining actions taken
- Where recommendations are not implemented, the rationale will be recorded

Final accountability for decisions rests with the Programme SRO, informed by DMG advice.

------

## Confidentiality

All DMG members are required to:

- Maintain strict confidentiality of all information reviewed
- Declare any conflicts of interest
- Comply with applicable data protection and information governance requirements

------

## Reporting and Records

- Brief written summaries of meetings will be produced
- Actions and recommendations will be tracked to resolution
- Records will be retained in line with governance requirements

------

## Review of Terms of Reference

These Terms of Reference will be reviewed annually or if the scope of the programme changes.
