This document presents the TMR programme timeline using **three linked layers**:   

1. Programme milestones (overall goals)
2. Rolling operational timeline (near-term detail)
3. Standing monitoring activities (ongoing work)

The aim is to retain operational truth while keeping the document readable, updateable, and extensible across the full study lifecycle.

## Layer 1: Programme Milestones 
### The Broad Project Milestones

These milestones define the critical path of the programme. They change rarely and should remain short and readable.

## 20 Mar – 24 Apr 2026 
### Staggered Screening and Baseline

**NOTE:** Screening and baseline assessments are *staggered* across this period. As a result, all downstream activities (intervention start, follow-up, monitoring) will also occur on a rolling, overlapping basis rather than as single fixed dates.

## Remainder of 2026
### Broad Phases for 2026

The following blocks outline the *expected flow of activity for the remainder of 2026*, recognising that recruitment, intervention delivery, and follow-up are staggered and overlapping. These blocks are indicative and will be refined as operational experience accumulates.

#### Late Apr – Jun 2026: Intervention Ramp-Up

Focus:

- Participants entering TMR at different start points
- Intensive early-phase monitoring

Key activities:

- Rolling starts of TMR intervention
- Medication review and adjustment
- Ongoing coaching and support
- Close safety monitoring (particularly insulin-treated participants)
- Data completeness and fidelity checks

#### Jul – Oct 2026: Mid-Programme Delivery and Early Follow-Up

Focus:

- Participants completing initial TMR phases
- Transition to food reintroduction and maintenance

Key activities:

- Completion of 12-week TMR phase (rolling)
- Structured food reintroduction
- Early follow-up measurements (3–6 months, staggered)
- Review of retention and engagement patterns
- Interim process review

#### Nov – Dec 2026: Follow-Up, Consolidation, and Learning

Focus:

- Medium-term outcomes
- Programme refinement

Key activities:

- Rolling 6–9 month follow-up visits
- Continued safety and medication oversight
- Qualitative data collection (participants and staff)
- Preliminary outcome summaries
- Planning for 2027 follow-up and sustainability decisions

### Notes on Staggered Delivery

- Most activities after baseline will occur on a **rolling cohort basis**
- Monitoring and reporting should use **windows** rather than fixed dates
- This structure supports flexibility while preserving governance and oversight


## Layer 3: Ongoing Activities

These activities run throughout the programme and should not be duplicated in date-specific tables.

| Activity                                                 | Frequency           | Responsible  |

| Monitor baseline completeness                            | Weekly              | IH           |
| Monitor follow-up visit attendance and data completeness | Weekly              | IH           |
| Project team meeting                                     | Fortnightly         | ALL          |
| Review missed appointments                               | Fortnightly         | Project team |
| Data Monitoring Group meeting                            | Monthly / quarterly | DMG          |
