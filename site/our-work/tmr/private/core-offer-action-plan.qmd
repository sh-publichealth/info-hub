## The situation

* Annual health budget: ~£9m
* Recurrent overspend: ~£1.5m per year
* Direction from funders: reduce costs, soon
* No clear service-level costing
* External consultancy has not delivered

**Action is required now, with limited time and resource**

---

## The core challenge 

We offer a quality service.

Our staff work hard and follow best-practice.

**This is a decision framework problem**:

* What services should a very small, isolated health system provide?
* How do we decide this transparently and defensibly?

---

## Expectations gap

* Public expectation: UK-level services
* Reality: small island, limited workforce, fragile supply chains
* NICE guidance reflects UK conditions, not St Helena conditions

**We must align services with local feasibility, not imported assumptions**

---

## Our guiding principle

**Core services first**

Core services are those that:

* Prevent *avoidable death* or irreversible harm
* Can be delivered safely and consistently in St Helena
* Are legally and ethically defensible within constraints

---

## What is possible now (and what is not)

**Not possible immediately**

* Full service costing
* Full cost-effectiveness modelling
* Definitive list of services to withdraw

**Possible immediately**

* A clear decision logic
* Rapid service mapping
* Identification of high-risk, high-cost areas

---

## A simple decision framework

Each service is assessed across three questions:

1. **Clinical necessity**
   Does withdrawal materially increase risk of death or irreversible harm?

2. **System feasibility**
   Can this be delivered safely and reliably with our workforce and infrastructure?

3. **Cost pressure signal**
   Is this likely to be a major driver of overspend?

---

## What this framework does

* Sorts services without needing full costing
* Makes value judgements explicit
* Creates an auditable decision trail
* Supports prioritisation under pressure

**This is sorting, not final ranking**

---

## Rapid service mapping (next phase)

A short, structured exercise:

* List all current service lines. For each service, record:

  * Staff / locums / on-call requirements  
  * Likelihood of off-island referral
  * Known safety or litigation sensitivity

Outcome:

* Clearly core services OR clearly discretionary services
* Services needing deeper review

---

## Use of evidence and guidance

* NICE and international guidance will inform clinical evidence
* They will not define automatic service entitlement
* Assumptions about volume, staffing and infrastructure must be tested locally

**Evidence-informed, but adapted locally**

---

## Role of modern tools

To reduce burden of this review on limited staff:

* Build private LLM to summarise and compare guidance
* Extract hidden assumptions in UK-based recommendations
* Support, not replace, human decision-making

All outputs reviewed and documented carefully

---

## Opportunity cost {visibility="hidden"}

Every resource committed to low-value or fragile services:

* Reduces capacity for prevention
* Reduces chronic disease management
* Increases system instability

**Doing nothing also has consequences**

---

## What this approach delivers

* A credible, transparent decision process
* A defensible response to funders
* A foundation for longer-term reform
* Immediate grip on financial risk

---

## What is needed

* Agreement on the decision framework
* Permission to prioritise explicitly
* Time to complete rapid service mapping
* Support for a phased, evidence-led process

---

## Closing message

This is a big task.

But it is manageable if:

* Decisions are explicit
* Trade-offs are acknowledged
* Evidence is used proportionately

**This plan puts St Helena Health back in control**
