## Purpose of eligibility assessment

Eligibility criteria are used to:

- Ensure participant safety
- Identify those most likely to benefit from TMR
- Apply inclusion rules consistently and fairly

Eligibility is assessed in **two stages**:

1. Registry-based pre-screening
2. In-person screening confirmation

Eligibility is only final once **both stages** are complete.

---

## Stage 1: Registry-based eligibility (pre-screening)

Stage 1 eligibility is assessed using **existing Diabetes Registry data only**.

An individual may proceed to screening if all of the following apply:

- Age **≤ 65 years**
- Diagnosed with **type 2 diabetes**
- Diabetes duration **≤ 6 years**  
  - May be extended to **≤ 10 years** if recruitment numbers are low
- At least **one diabetes-related visit in the past 12 months**
- Likely **BMI ≥ 25** (confirmed at screening)

Individuals meeting these criteria are flagged as *potentially eligible* and may be invited to screening.

No consent is obtained at this stage.

---

## Stage 2: Screening visit eligibility

Eligibility is confirmed at an **in-person screening visit**.

To remain eligible, the individual must:

- Have **BMI ≥ 25** confirmed by measured height and weight
- Have no exclusion criteria (see below)
- Be willing and able to attend scheduled study visits
- Be willing to consider participation in the full programme

Eligibility status is recorded in the screening instrument.

---

## Exclusion criteria (apply at any stage)

An individual is **not eligible** if any of the following apply:

- Pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning pregnancy
- Severe renal impairment (e.g. eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m²)
- Active cancer
- Myocardial infarction or stroke within the past 6 months
- Severe heart failure (NYHA class III or IV)
- Active eating disorder
- Active substance use disorder
- Prior bariatric surgery
- Any condition where the clinical team judges TMR to be unsafe or inappropriate

Clinical judgement should be documented where exclusions are discretionary.

---

## Participants using insulin

Insulin use is **not an automatic exclusion**.

However:
- Insulin-treated participants require enhanced clinical oversight
- Medication adjustment protocols must be followed
- Insulin status should be clearly flagged at screening and baseline

Insulin-treated participants may be analysed separately.

---

## If eligibility is not met

If an individual does not meet eligibility criteria:

- This should be recorded in the screening log
- The reason for ineligibility should be documented
- Routine diabetes care continues as normal

Ineligibility does **not** affect access to services.

---

## Systems and documentation

Eligibility assessment uses:
- Diabetes Registry (Stage 1)
- Eligibility screening REDCap instrument (Stage 2)
- Recruitment and screening logs

Eligibility decisions must be auditable.

## Key principle

Eligibility assessment is a **safety and consistency function**, not a recruitment tool.

When in doubt, pause, document, and escalate.
