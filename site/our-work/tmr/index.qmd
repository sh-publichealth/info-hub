Many people on Saint Helena are living with type 2 diabetes, and it affects families in every district. Managing diabetes can be tiring, expensive, and stressful. This study aims to find out whether a simple, structured food programme can help make life easier and healthier for people with diabetes.

## What is the programme?

The programme is a guided, short-term eating plan. For a few weeks, everyday meals are swapped for specially prepared soups and shakes. These products are designed to give you everything your body needs, just with far fewer calories. After this first phase, ordinary foods are slowly added back in, with support from the health team every step of the way.

Studies in other countries have shown that this type of programme can help many people lose a significant amount of weight and improve their blood sugar levels—sometimes by so much that they no longer need diabetes tablets.

## Who is taking part?

Two groups of adults with type 2 diabetes will join:

- **People who are not using insulin**, who give us the clearest picture of how the programme might affect diabetes.
- **People who do use insulin.** Their treatment needs closer supervision when starting the programme, so they are followed as a separate group to make sure everything is done safely.

## What will happen during the study?

Everyone in the programme will:

- Meet regularly with the health team  
- Have their weight, blood pressure and waist measured  
- Have blood tests to monitor their diabetes and general health  
- Fill in short questionnaires about their wellbeing and how they feel about living with diabetes  

Some people will also be asked to share quick check-ins using their phones—simple “how are you doing today?” messages that help us understand what makes the programme easier or harder in everyday life. These are optional but very helpful.

## How will we know if it works?

To understand the programme’s impact, we will compare the progress of participants with people from the island’s diabetes registry who are not doing the programme. This is not a traditional trial where people are randomly assigned—everything is done in a way that fits St Helena’s small, close-knit community. Our team will use careful, fair comparisons to see whether the programme truly makes a difference.

## Why does this matter for St Helena?

If this programme works well, it could:

- Reduce the need for diabetes medicines, including insulin  
- Improve people’s energy, wellbeing and day-to-day life  
- Lower the risk of long-term diabetes complications  
- Help the island save money on expensive medication imports  
- Show what kind of support helps people succeed in making big health changes  

Most importantly, it will help us understand whether this is something **the whole island** should have access to in the future.
