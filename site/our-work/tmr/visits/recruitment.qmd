## Purpose of Recruitment

Recruitment is the first real point of contact between the study and potential participants. How this is handled matters.  
The aim is to invite people into the programme in a way that is clear, respectful, and quietly optimistic about what the Total Meal Replacement (TMR) intervention can offer.

Recruitment is about **offering an opportunity**, not persuading.

## Who We Approach

Potential participants are identified through:
- Pre-screened diabetes clinic lists (using registry data), and  
- Responses to local advertising (e.g. newspaper, Facebook).

Clinic-based lists are randomly ordered to ensure a fair and transparent approach.  
Not everyone contacted will be eligible or interested — this is expected and entirely acceptable.

## First Contact: Telephone Call

Initial contact is usually by telephone, using the approved recruitment and screening script.

The purpose of this call is to:
- Briefly introduce the TMR programme and the evaluation  
- Check basic eligibility  
- Gauge interest in hearing more  
- Arrange an in-person screening visit, if appropriate  

This call **is not consent** and **does not commit** the person to taking part.

The tone should be calm, human, and unhurried. Many people with diabetes have lived with ongoing treatment escalation and mixed experiences of lifestyle advice. This call introduces something different: a structured, supported programme that has helped many people lose weight, reduce medication, and feel better in their day-to-day lives.

## How We Describe the TMR Programme

When describing TMR, staff should emphasise that it is:
- A **time-limited, intensive programme** with close clinical support  
- Focused on **significant weight loss** to improve blood glucose control  
- Designed to **reduce medication burden** and, for some people, achieve diabetes remission  
- **Evidence-based**, with strong results seen elsewhere and now being carefully evaluated in St Helena  

Avoid guarantees or promises. The emphasis is on support, structure, and learning what works for each individual.

## Screening and Next Steps

If someone appears eligible and interested, an in-person screening visit should be scheduled.

At the screening visit:
- Eligibility is confirmed  
- The programme is explained in more detail  
- Questions and concerns are addressed  
- A baseline visit is scheduled if the person wishes to proceed  

If someone is not eligible, or decides not to take part, thank them for their time.  
Where appropriate, they may be invited to contribute as a control participant using routine data.

## Core Message to Convey

This programme is about **giving people a genuine chance to change how diabetes affects their lives**, with proper support and careful monitoring.

The role of recruitment is simply to open that door — clearly, honestly, and with quiet confidence in the intervention.
